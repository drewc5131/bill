			<h1> Who are we?</h1>
			<p> We are a locally ran, family bowling operation. Like you, we love the Kennedy's and their work. RIP JFK. 
				We first started in 1978 with our first location on Prouty Lane in Rutland MA. My bitch wife Karen has since left me, but me and my boys are still here.
				We have since expanded to many new locations, and with the recent Disney buyout, we will have even more soon! Too bad I didn't make a prenup.
